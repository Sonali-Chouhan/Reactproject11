        Indore is a city in west-central India. It’s known for the 7-story
        Rajwada Palace and the Lal Baag Palace, which date back to Indore’s
        19th-century Holkar dynasty. The Holkar rulers are honored by a cluster
        of tombs and cenotaphs at Chhatri Baag. The night market Sarafa Bazar
        sells street food. East is the Indo-Gothic Gandhi Hall and clock tower.
        The Jain temple Kanch Mandir has a mirrored mosaic interior.
